Be it the toys they play with, the kind of exercise they have on a daily basis, the amount of time they stay out and socialise. Just like you don’t compromise with these things, the diet of your pet shouldn’t be ignored, either. Your dog needs a nutritious diet that meets with their unique needs. A balanced diet is essential for your dog’s overall health, happiness, and well-being.

        <h3 className="blog-mini-heading">What are the key nutrients that should be included your dog’s diet?</h3>
        <p className="blog-para">A healthy dog’s diet should include:</p>
        <ol className="blog-ol">
        <li>High-quality protein sources (meat, fish, or eggs)</li>
        <li>Whole grains (brown rice, oats, or barley)</li>

        <p className="blog-para">In an article published by the National Library of Medicine, the authors conducted a trial at a private kennel located in Naples, Italy. In the trial 50 adult dogs were included and haematological, biochemical and parasitological tests were performed on them before introducing them to various diets. At the end of the trial, these tests were conducted again. The preliminary results showed that only a few haematological parameters were affected when balanced diets were administered to healthy dogs. The sources of carbohydrates (starch and dietary fiber) and the appropriate equilibrium between energy nutrients (e.g., protein, fat, and starch) could modify the indicators of lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism (AST, fructosamine, lipase, triglycerides) and improve liver function.</p>
        <p className="blog-para">According to the Science based guide for pet owners published by the National Academies Press “Your Dog’s Nutritional Needs”, an adult dog’s daily diet can contain up to 50% carbohydrates by weight, including 2.5-4.5% from fibre. A minimum approximately 5.5% of the diet should come from fats and 10% from proteins. Petfood labels do not generally list amounts of essential nutrients in grams, hence pet parents should not completely rely on packaged pet food to complete their dog’s nutrition goals.</p>
        <p className="blog-para">Pet parents should opt for fresh, home cooked meals for their pups. This will ensure that your dog stays fit and happy in the long term.</p>
        <h3 className="blog-mini-heading">Some things to keep in mind</h3>
        <ol className="blog-ol">
        <li>Consult with your veterinarian to determine the best diet for your dog according to their age, health, and lifestyle.</li>
        <li>Choose a high-quality commercial dog food that best fulfills the dietary needs of your dog.</li>
        <li>Make a meal plan for your dog, making sure to include home-cooked meals <em>after consulting with your veterinarian</em>.</li>
        <li>Avoid over-supplementing your dog. Do not add supplements to your dog’s meal unnecessarily, as it can lead to nutritional imbalance.</li>
        <li>Whenever you want to change your dog’s diet, do it gradually by reducing the quantity of the current food and introducing the new food in small quantities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="blog-mini-heading">Conclusion</p>
        <p className="blog-para">A balanced diet is crucial for your dog’s health and well-being. Keep in mind that every dog is unique and their needs vary. Make sure you consult your veterinarian to make necessary changes in your dog’s diet. By providing your pup a healthy and wholesome diet, you will ensure that they live a comfortable and healthy life. Happy feeding!</p>
